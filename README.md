# Claymore: Additional Core Libraries for Java

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-2.5.0-blue.svg)](https://raven-computing.com/products/claymore/claymore-2.5.0.zip)

Claymore is a set of core libraries which are often used in our Java projects. We wanted to make some of them open source in the hope that others might find them useful. The provided APIs are complementary to the native Java libraries, for example by adding support for DataFrames, readers/writers for CSV-files, a parser for command line arguments, and more.

## Getting Started

Claymore will be available on the Maven Central Repository in the near future.

## Compatibility

Claymore requires **Java 8** or higher. 

## Documentation

Take a look at the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/raven-computing/claymore/wiki/Home).

## License

The Claymore library is licensed under the Apache License Version 2 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
